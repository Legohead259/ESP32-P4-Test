# Hardware Setup

---

The LAN for the RDTE testbed has a static IP domain and each device has a static IP address.
The domain was chosen largely at random and configured according to the instructions and software provided by MikroTik for their RouterOS.
Each device was confirmed to be connected using the IP device management features present on the CRS112.
These features were also used to ensure power is being appropriately provided to each microcontroller through the Ethernet connection.

The autonomy computer was then connected to the first microcontroller and the first set of firmware was uploaded to enable OTA functionality.
